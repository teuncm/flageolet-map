# Flageolet Map

What are flageolets? Glad you asked! To answer this, we need to dive into the physics of vibrating strings. When exciting a string, it vibrates in modes (harmonics) that divide the length of the string into an integer ($1, 2, 3, \dots$) number of divisions. 

The frequency $f$ of a vibrating string depends on the length $L$ of the string, its tension $T$ and its density $\mu$ as follows: $f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$. This means that the frequency of a string is inversely proportional to its length. Given the fundamental frequency $f_0$ of a tensioned string, its harmonics will therefore vibrate at $f_0$, $2f_0$, $3f_0$, $\dots$.

A flageolet is played on string instruments using the nodes of string harmonics. When the string is plucked this way, all oscillating nodes that don't have a node at that position are dampened, making the string vibrate at the resulting higher fundamental frequency and its harmonics.

Fretboards are constructed using 12-tone equal temperament, which effectively displaces each consecutive fret by a factor of $\frac{1}{2 ^ {1/12}}$. Flageolets are seen to be played at the 5th, 7th, 9th and 12th frets, but are they actually located there? This flageolet map shows that all flageolets are offset slightly except those at fret 12 and 24 (if your guitar has one). Moreover, this map shows all flageolet locations, even those located past the fretboard.
