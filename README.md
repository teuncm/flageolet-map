# Flageolet Map

What are flageolets? Glad you asked! To answer this, we need to dive into the physics of vibrating strings. An excited string tends to vibrate in modes (harmonics) that divide the length of the string into an integer ($1, 2, 3, \dots$) number of divisions. 

The fundamental frequency $f_0$ of a vibrating string depends on the length $L$ of the string, its tension $T$ and its density $\mu$ as follows: 

$$f_0 = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

This implies that the frequency of a vibrating string is inversely proportional to its length. Given the fundamental frequency $f_0$ of any tensioned string, its harmonics will therefore vibrate at $f_0$, $2f_0$, $3f_0$, $\dots$.

A flageolet is played on string instruments using the nodes of string harmonics. When the string is plucked this way, all harmonics that don't have a node at that position are dampened, making the string vibrate at the resulting higher fundamental frequency and its respective harmonics.

Fretboards are constructed using 12-tone equal temperament, which effectively displaces each consecutive fret away from the nut by a factor of 

$$2 ^ {-1/12}$$

such that the 12th fret is located halfway between the nut and bridge and the spacing between each fret decreases exponentially. Flageolets are seen to be played at the 5th, 7th, 9th and 12th frets, but are they actually located there? This flageolet map shows that all flageolets are offset slightly except those at fret 12 and 24. Moreover, this map shows all flageolet locations, even those located past the fretboard.
